Working with Material Symbols and a barebones react config, using LiveServer instead of create-react-app. Attempt at building a Pomodoro clock using a minimal amount of code, currently the application can:-
- Play/pause current time
- Change break/session length
- Play sound on break/session ending
- Reset the timer to stated session length
